<p>
This rule allows the define some homemade XML rules with help of an XPath expression.
</p>

<p>
Violations are created depending on the return value of the XPath expression. If the XPath expression returns:
  <ul>
    <li>a single or list of AST nodes, then a line violation with the given message is created for each node</li>
    <li>a boolean, then a file violation with the given message is created only if the boolean is true</li>
    <li>anything else, no violation is created</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of an XPath expression to log a violation on each 'td' tag using the 'nowrap' deprecated attribute:
<pre><code>//td[@nowrap]</code></pre>
</p>
